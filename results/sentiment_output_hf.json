    "text": "thanks god it wasn t too hot or too humid when i was visiting the park otherwise it would be a big issue ( there is not a lot of shade ). i have arrived around 10 : 30am and left at 6pm. unfortunately i didn t last until evening parade, but 8. 5 hours was too much for me. there is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy. it wasn t extremely busy and the longest time i had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes ( which is really not that bad ). although i had an amazing time, i felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. the park itself is quite small ( i was really expecting something grand even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small ). the food options are good, few coffee shops ( including starbucks ) and plenty of gift shops. there was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere. all together it was a great day out and i really enjoyed it.",

    "text": "have been to disney world, disneyland anaheim and tokyo disneyland but i feel that disneyland hong kong is really too small to be called a disneyland. it has way too few rides and attractions. souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other disneyland as well. basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to disney. the food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. bottled water, however, was very expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. the parade was pretty good. it was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed disney property.",
