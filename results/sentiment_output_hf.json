    "text": "thanks god it wasn t too hot or too humid when i was visiting the park otherwise it would be a big issue ( there is not a lot of shade ). i have arrived around 10 : 30am and left at 6pm. unfortunately i didn t last until evening parade, but 8. 5 hours was too much for me. there is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy. it wasn t extremely busy and the longest time i had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes ( which is really not that bad ). although i had an amazing time, i felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. the park itself is quite small ( i was really expecting something grand even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small ). the food options are good, few coffee shops ( including starbucks ) and plenty of gift shops. there was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere. all together it was a great day out and i really enjoyed it.",

    "text": "hk disneyland is a great compact park. unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off ( including the famous castle ) if you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as la disneyland. we did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks ( and avoid the souvenir shops if you can ) regardless, kids will love it.",

    "text": "have been to disney world, disneyland anaheim and tokyo disneyland but i feel that disneyland hong kong is really too small to be called a disneyland. it has way too few rides and attractions. souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other disneyland as well. basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to disney. the food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. bottled water, however, was very expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. the parade was pretty good. it was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed disney property.",

    "text": "think of it as an intro to disney magic for the little ones. almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1. 5days. one drawback was the timing. for example, disney's storybook theatre is closed wed thu for private events. some restaurants close mid week tue thur as well. so best not to plan your visit during mid week. the biggest disappointment is the food at the park. even maxim's is so so only. the only decent restaurant is main street corner cafe and the main street bakery. and do be prepared for the typical abrupt hongkong style service from the serving staff.",

    "text": "feel so let down with this place, the disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station, bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there, it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. dont waste your money. walt disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. seems they are building something but who knows what. no atmosphere of fun and fantasy.",

    "text": "i can go on talking about disneyland. whatever i say about it, is less. disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. starting from the entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. even the mtr trains and the station is specially designed. in my opinion one should by a two day ticket to explore it well if you have time. else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. an online two day ticket can save around hkd 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket. must not miss attractions include the jungle river cruise, micky's phillhar magic ( a 4d show ), the lion king showit is better to have some home work regarding the show timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover. it is better to avoid sundays or the public holidays to avoid rush.",
